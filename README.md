# Wendell Depot Musuem Layout (proposed)

This is a layout I am proposing for the Wendell Depot Musuem that Ed Hines is
planning to house in the old Wendell Depot store/post office that was run by
the late Anna Hartjens.

It is a double oval, with a 10'x3.5' section to be visible in the store's 
display windows.  This section is a model of about 1000' of the B&M main line 
(in its former double track state), centered on the grade crossing at Wendell 
Depot Road.  Being an oval, it can be set up as continious running trains in a 
loop with one to four trains running across the "visible" portion in both 
directions at intervals.  The grade crossing will have working lights and 
bells and maybe gates.
