# Wendell Historical Society Musuem at Wendell Depot

This is a proposed model railroad layout at the Wendell Historical Society
Musuem at Wendell Depot. It models the section of the old B&M Railroad that
goes through Wendell Depot. It will be placed at the large display windows at
the from of the musuem. The view will be the view south from a point just
north of the tracks, centered on Wendell Depot Road. Features include crossing
gates across Wendell Depot Road and a railroad bridge over the Millers River
near the "west" end.  Also a portion of Wendell Depot Road, West Orange Road, 
and Kentfield Road and the various buildings that make up the village of 
Wendell Depot.

The layout is actually a oval that is 6 ft. by 14 ft., with 10 ft. "visible" 
and the rest of the layout "hidden".  At the back is a four track "staging" 
yard, where up to 4 trains (two eastbound and two westbound) can be made up. 
The layout will be set up with automated operation, with the 4 trains running 
one at a time through the "visible" section in alterniting directions.
